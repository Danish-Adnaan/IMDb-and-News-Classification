# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and News Article Classification

## Part A: IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that determines whether text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we analyze IMDb movie reviews to predict sentiment using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms. The built machine learning model helps understand public opinion and provides useful insights for movie platforms, producers, and critics.

### Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning classification model that predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of IMDb movie reviews. The dataset contains reviews labeled as positive or negative. This project applies text preprocessing, feature extraction (such as TF-IDF), and various classification algorithms to build a robust sentiment classifier. Standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate model performance.

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** IMDb  
- **Features:**  
  - Text of the review  
  - Sentiment label ("positive" or "negative")

### Deliverables
- Data exploration and preprocessing: Analyze trends, check for missing values or class imbalance, clean and preprocess text (stop word removal, punctuation and special characters removal, tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, vectorization).
- Feature engineering: Extract features (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec), generate textual features (word count, character count, avg word length).
- Model development: Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Model evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Final report and presentation: Summarize the project process and findings. Prepare a video presentation (up to 5 minutes) outlining methodology and insights.

### Success Criteria
- Classification model achieves good performance on test data with accuracy and F1-score.
- Insights on influential factors (word frequency, review length) are communicated.
- Model can predict sentiment for new reviews.
- Results and analysis are clearly presented in the final report and video.
- Use of informative visualizations (bar charts, confusion matrix, word clouds).

### Tools Required
- Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
- Text preprocessing libraries: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn (vectorizers)
- Visualization libraries: matplotlib, seaborn

# Part B: News Article Classification

### Overview
News organizations and aggregators benefit from categorizing articles (e.g., sports, politics, technology) to enhance content recommendation and management. This project develops a machine learning model to classify news articles into predefined categories using their textual content.

### Problem Statement
Build a classification model that automatically categorizes news articles (e.g., sports, politics, technology) using labeled data. Focus on robust preprocessing, meaningful feature extraction, model training, and actionable insights on classification performance.

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** data_news  
- **Features:**  
  - News article text  
  - Category label (sports, politics, technology, etc.)

### Deliverables
- Data collection and preprocessing: Collect labeled articles, clean and preprocess text, handle missing/invalid data.
- Feature extraction: Use TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or bag-of-words. Conduct EDA on category distribution.
- Model development and training: Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM), train and tune them, use cross-validation.
- Model evaluation: Assess metrics (accuracy, F1-score), compare models, select best performer.
- Final report and presentation: Summarize methods, findings, and present results using visualizations. Include a video/slides presentation (max 5 minutes).

### Success Criteria
- Model achieves high accuracy and F1-score on test data.
- Successfully classifies new/unseen articles into correct categories.
- Insights provided on influential features/keywords driving classification.
- Process and results clearly documented and presented.
